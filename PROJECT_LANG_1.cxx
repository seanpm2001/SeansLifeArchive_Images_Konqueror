// About:
// I chose C++ as the first project language file for this project (SeansLifeArchive/Images/Konqueror) as C++ is the #1 most used language by KDE for their projects, and specifically the Konquerer web browser/file manager, and I wanted to represent it here with a project language file, as this is a project directly about the Konqueror software. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.
